You can easily see where changes were made.
This helps to follow the process of creating code and makes it easy to spot mistakes.
Sounds like a great feature for detecting bugs and typos :D

Manual commits let programmer make each commit a logical change.
It allows to keep history clear and enables the author to see what he was working on.
It also gives you the feeling of achieving goals every time you make a commit.

git log shows history of a repository which is super need for tracking what changes ware made in the project
git diff takes id of 2 commits and shows exact changes that happened between them

If I know that I can go back to the past version of my project I'm not afraid of messing around.
In case I break somethin I can now just use git checkout to travel thru time :D
