Here I'm going to list all git command that I'll learn
Cheat sheet: https://github.com/github/training-kit/blob/master/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf

git init - creates the git repository
git status - displays basic info about the current repository

git add - stages files
git commit - creates commit with a given message and all staged files

git checkout - switch the active branch or go back to past commit
git checkout -b [branch name] - create branch and checkout to it
git reset - removes files form staging area
git reset-hard - discards changes

git log - displays history of commits
git log --graph --oneline [1. branch name] [2. branch name] - visualizes commit history between two branches
git diff - shows difference between two commits
git show [commit id] - shows difference between a commit and it's parent
git diff [no commit ids] - shows difference between working directory and staging area
git diff --staged - shows changes between staged files and last commit

git branch - show branches in repository
git branch [branch name] - creates new branch

git merge [branch name] - merges given branch into currently checked out branch
git branch -d [branch name] - deletes branch

git remote - lists all remotes
git remote -v - gives more info about remotes

git fetch [origin] - downloads all branch changes form remote. 
They can by accessed using for example origin/master - that is a version of master how it is on remote
Then you might want to merge origin/master to master and make commit

git pull [origin] - is like running git fetch -> git merge -> git commit
